The following enhancement is included with this release:

* With this update, the `kubernetes-nmstate` Operator now automatically retries failed node network configuration policy (NNCP) applications with exponential backoff (up to five retries, with one- to thirty-second delays). This enhancement reduces false failures from transient network issues and improves Operator reliability. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-55353[OCPBUGS-55353])
